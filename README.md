## Icons Installation
### Balsamiq 2.x.x
1. Set up your [Account Assets Folder](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/200694) first, if it's already set up you can skip this step:
	* On Windows and Linux, create a directory called `Balsamiq Mockups` inside your `Documents` directory. Inside the new `Balsamiq Mockups` directory, create a new directory called `assets`.
	* On Mac OS X, create a folder called `Balsamiq Mockups` inside your `Documents` folder. Inside the new `Balsamiq Mockups` folder, create a new folder called `assets`.
1. [Download the pack](https://github.com/jstawarczyk/material-design-balsamiq/releases) and unzip the files.
2. Move the icons from the unzipped `icons` folder to your asset folder (created in step 1).
3. After you restart Balsamiq, the icons will be available under 'Account Assets' when you want to select an icon in the Icon Library. They are also searchable through their official Material Design names.

### Balsamiq 3.x.x
1. [Download the pack](https://github.com/jstawarczyk/material-design-balsamiq/releases) and unzip the files.
2. In the **Project** menu, go to **Import** > **Assets**. Navigate to the unzipped `icons` folder and select all icon files for import.
3. Icons are available immediately.

## Pick Icon
Icons have the same name as in [live preview](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/) with "material" prefix. So when you want to list all icons from "content" category - type "material content":
